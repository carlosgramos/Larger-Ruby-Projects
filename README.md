# Larger-Ruby-Projects

These are some larger, self contained Ruby projects that I use to pratice my programming.

The first of the projects is a URL parser, which does exactly what the name implies. Pass in a URL as an argument and it will break it down into its component parts.

A test file is also included for requirements verification.
